Listens to conversations (like those happening on WhatsApp or any web app),

Detects if the conversation contains scam or fraud patterns, and

Gives you a live alert when it suspects such behavior.

Since apps like WhatsApp don’t allow direct tapping into calls or capturing audio for privacy and security reasons, we’ll focus on what is technically feasible:

✅ Feasible Alternative:
Build a browser-based AI assistant that listens to conversations via microphone (with your permission).

It analyzes real-time audio using a speech-to-text system (like Google’s or OpenAI’s Whisper).

The transcribed text is then analyzed by a language model (like Gemini via API) to detect scam/fraud patterns.

You get an instant warning/alert if a scam pattern is detected.

🔧 Here's What You Can Actually Build:
💡 Project Name: ScamGuard AI
🧠 Key Components:
Frontend (website or browser extension):

Accesses microphone (with user permission)

Continuously listens and transcribes audio

Speech-to-Text:

Use Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper API, or Web Speech API to convert live audio into text

Scam Detection Engine:

Send transcribed text to Gemini API (or OpenAI GPT) using a prompt-based scam detection model

Alert System:

If scam phrases detected, show an alert on screen or notify user

🔐 Ethical Note
You cannot and should not secretly record WhatsApp or app calls due to:

Privacy violations

Legal restrictions in many countries

You can only record audio from your microphone with permission, not secretly or automatically in background for other apps.

✅ Safe Prompt for Gemini API
Here’s a prompt you can safely use with a Gemini (or OpenAI) API to detect scam behavior:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
You are a fraud and scam detection system. Your job is to analyze conversations and detect if they include scam or fraudulent activity.

Here is the conversation:
---
{conversation_text}
---

Based on this, is the conversation likely to be a scam or fraud? Answer "Yes" or "No" and briefly explain why.
🌍 Multilingual Support
Use Google’s or Whisper’s multilingual speech-to-text to transcribe conversations in any language. Then pass to Gemini for analysis.
